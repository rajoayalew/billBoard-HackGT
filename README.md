# billBoard
Creating a more equitable healthcare system, one bill at a time. 
billBoard increases transparency in medical costs by collecting and comparing data on the most common medical procedures.

billBoard-HackGT was submitted to HackGT9, Georgia Tech's annual hackathon.  billBoard won first place in the Carelon sponsor challenge.

Passionate about this idea and determined to make a difference in healthcare, team billBoard has continued to work on the project post-hackathon. Check out the changes made to billBoard since then: https://github.com/GT-BB/billBoard
