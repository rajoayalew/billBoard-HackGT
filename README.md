# billBoard
Creating a more equitable healthcare system, one bill at a time. 
billBoard increases transparency in medical costs by collecting and comparing data on the most common medical procedures.

billBoard was created at HackGT9, Georgia Tech's annual hackathon, where it won first place in the Carelon sponsor challenge.  (https://devpost.com/software/billboard-5rjkv1)

Passionate about this idea and determined to make a difference in healthcare, team billBoard has continued to work on the project post-hackathon. Check out the changes made to billBoard since then: https://github.com/GT-BB/billBoard
